### io.js Week of February 6th 2015

Atom &amp; nw.js adopt io.js, Linux Tracing, and much more.

Every Friday we’re going to start posting weekly updates of the activity in and around io.js.

We looked back at all the contributions in January and found that it was the **3rd most active month in Node history (294 commits)** and the single most active month in almost **three years (308 commits in February 2012)**. With the contribution growth we’ve seen so far we expect February to be even more active.
